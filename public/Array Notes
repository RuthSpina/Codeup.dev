JS foreach array setup:
array.forEach(function(value, key, array){
});
////

js has a function that lets you pass arguments and turns it into an array.

function testArguments(){
    console.log(arguments);
};
///

BOM and DOM

Timeout:

var delay = 5000; // delay time in milliseconds

var timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
    alert('Here is a delayed hello!');
}, delay);

_____________________


Interval:

creates a delayed alert that pops up on screen in window.

set interval is like set timeOut but repeats it- it continues until you reset it. 
to reset - set interval: clearInterval(interbalId);
___________________

var delay = 5000; // delay time in milliseconds

var timeoutId = setTimeout(function () {
    alert('Here is a delayed hello!');
}, delay);

*var interval = setInterval(function, interval);
as opposed to :
*var interval = setInterval(function(), interval);

*** Don't put open parenthesis on the function because it calls it immediately.when you only want it called with the interval.

DOM

get elements by id- you get one
get elements by class you get an array
